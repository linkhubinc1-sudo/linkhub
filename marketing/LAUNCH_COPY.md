### Tagline (60 chars max)
Free Linktree alternative - No catch, no limits, no BS

### Description
**Sick of paying $5-24/month for a list of links?**

I built LinkHub because link-in-bio tools are a scam. They charge subscription fees for something that should be free.

**LinkHub is:**
- 100% free (unlimited links, forever)
- Click analytics included
- Custom themes
- No "upgrade to unlock" tricks
- No transaction fees on your sales
- No affiliate link hijacking
- We don't sell your data

**Pro version ($5/mo or $49 lifetime):**
- Remove "Powered by LinkHub" badge
- Premium themes
- Priority support

That's it. The free version has everything you need. Pro just removes branding.

I built this for creators who are tired of being nickel-and-dimed by every tool.

### First Comment (as maker)
Hey PH!

I'm the solo dev behind LinkHub. Here's why I built it:

I saw creators paying $24/month to Linktree for... a list of links. That's insane.

The core features should be free. Period.

I'm not trying to build a billion-dollar company. I just want to help creators keep more of their money.

Try it out, roast it, let me know what's missing. I'm building in public and shipping fast.

**Title:** I built a free Linktree alternative because $24/month for a list of links is insane

**Body:**
Just launched LinkHub - a completely free link-in-bio tool.

**Why I built it:**
- Linktree charges up to $24/month
- Most "free" alternatives limit you to 3-5 links
- Many hijack your affiliate links or sell your data

**What LinkHub offers (free forever):**
- Unlimited links
- Click analytics
- Custom themes
- No hidden limits
- No data selling
- No affiliate hijacking

**Pro ($5/mo or $49 lifetime):**
- Removes the small "Powered by LinkHub" badge
- Premium themes

That's literally it. No other restrictions.

Would love feedback from fellow builders. What would make you switch from Linktree?

### r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Linktree charges $24/month. I built a free alternative. Here's what I learned.

**Body:**
6 months ago I noticed something: link-in-bio tools are a cash grab.

Linktree charges $5-24/month for what's essentially a webpage with links. Their free tier limits you to force upgrades.

So I built LinkHub.

**The model:**
- Free tier: Everything you need (unlimited links, analytics, themes)
- Pro ($5/mo): Removes branding badge, premium themes

**What I DON'T do:**
- No transaction fees on your products
- No affiliate link hijacking (yes, some tools do this)
- No selling user data
- No artificial limits to force upgrades

**Results so far:**
- [X] users signed up
- Most stay on free (and that's fine)
- Pro conversions come from people who want clean branding

**Lesson:** You don't need to squeeze every dollar from users. Build something good, charge fair prices, and people will support you.

Curious what other simple SaaS tools you think are overpriced?

**Title:** Stop paying for Linktree - free alternative that actually works

**Body:**
Quick post for anyone paying for link-in-bio tools:

I made a free one called LinkHub.

- Unlimited links (no "upgrade for more")
- Analytics (see what people click)
- Themes (make it look good)
- Actually free, not "free trial"

No catch. I make money from people who want to remove the small badge at the bottom.

Made this because I was tired of seeing creators waste money on overpriced tools.

## Indie Hackers

**Title:** Launched a free Linktree alternative - $0 MRR but growing fast

**Body:**
Hey IH!

Just launched LinkHub - a free link-in-bio tool.

**The idea:**
Linktree and similar tools charge $5-24/month for something that should be free. I built a version where:
- Free tier = fully functional (unlimited links, analytics, themes)
- Pro ($5/mo or $49 lifetime) = removes badge + premium themes

**Tech stack:**
- Node.js + Express
- SQLite (simple, no DevOps)
- Vanilla JS frontend (no React bloat)
- Railway for hosting

**What's working:**
- Organic signups from Twitter/X
- "Powered by LinkHub" badge driving referrals
- Lifetime deals converting well

**What's not:**
- Need more content marketing
- SEO takes forever
- Competing with VC-funded tools is hard

Would love feedback from the IH community. What features would make you switch?

## Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I just launched a free Linktree alternative.

No catch. No limits. No BS.

Here's why I built it (and why you should stop paying for link-in-bio tools):

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Linktree charges up to $24/month.

For what? A webpage with links.

Their free tier artificially limits you to force upgrades.

This is a scam.

**Tweet 3:**
So I built LinkHub.

Free tier includes:
- Unlimited links
- Click analytics
- Custom themes
- No data selling
- No affiliate hijacking

Everything you actually need.

**Tweet 4:**
"But how do you make money?"

Pro tier ($5/mo or $49 lifetime):
- Removes small "Powered by" badge
- Premium themes

That's it. No other restrictions.

**Tweet 5:**
Here's what I DON'T do:

❌ Take a cut of your sales
❌ Hijack your affiliate links
❌ Sell your data to advertisers
❌ Create fake urgency
❌ Limit features to force upgrades

**Tweet 6:**
Why am I telling you this?

Because I'm tired of seeing creators get milked by every tool.

You're already working hard. Keep more of your money.

**Tweet 7:**
Try it free: [link]

No credit card. No trial. Just works.

If you like it, share it with another creator.

If you don't, tell me what's missing.

Let's go.
