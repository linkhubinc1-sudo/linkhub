## The Real Talk

1. **Marketing is 90% of the work.** The app is done. Now you grind.
2. **First 10 users are the hardest.** After that, word of mouth helps.
3. **$100 MRR is realistic in 2-3 months** if you're consistent.
4. **$500+ MRR takes 6-12 months** for most people.
5. **Don't give up in month 1.** Most quit too early.
